# MCQ Generator and Evaluator

This repository contains a sophisticated Python application for generating and evaluating Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) tailored for educational purposes.
The project leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model via LangChain to produce quizzes based on input text and provides comprehensive feedback to refine the quiz
questions for better alignment with the target audience.
